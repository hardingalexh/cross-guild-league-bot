# CROSS GUILD LEAGUE BOT
## Discord Bot

This directory contains the Discord.py discord bot for the cross guild league. Dependencies are managed using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). The included `Dockerfile` will run this web application in a container. Note that discord.py doesn't have the best dev tooling, so changes are not hot reloaded - you must restart the process/container when making changes.
